====== Linear algebra ======
Created Friday 13 August 2021

when multiplying a matrix by a vector. The result is the linear combination of the matrix by that vector. for example

1,2,3                                   2
2,4,6				6
9,7,3				7

Will be equal to the sum of 2  time first column, 6 time second column and 7 times third column , the result is then summmed to gether  to produce the output vector.

if we imagine having all the possible 3 dimensional vector and then multiply the matrice with this , we get the column space of the matrix.

orthogonal matrix are perpendicular to each other, which orthonormal means they are reduced to vectors.

matrix multiplication can be seem as the sum of the colums of A multiply by the rows of B


A= LU   — This is about elimination (solving linear system) L is lower triangular and U is upper triangular
A=QR --- Q is an orthogonal matrix (the columns are perpendicular to each other, orhtonomal, is orthogonal but unit vector)

S= QLQ — S is a symmetric matrix, Q contans eigen vector, L is a diagonal matrix of eigen value.

Four fundamental subspace A of m by n rank r

— column space
— row space
— null space
— null space transpose

null space is all solutions to Ax=0

orthogonal matrix are square matrix. They do not change the geographic  lenght represented by the plane by which they multiply

for square orthogonal matrix, inverse is equal to the transpose of the matrix.

Household reflection = H = I-U^{T}U
a symetric matrix is   S=S^{T}

Ax=lamdda x  ,  where x is eigen vector and lamdba is the eigen values
