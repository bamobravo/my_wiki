I read your paper on 'Bayesian Synchronous Tree-Substitution Grammar Induction and Its Application to Sentence Compression'  and i found the sentence compression interesting expecially extractive sentence compression and the ideological similarity  to topic modeling. I also found other interesting publication on computational linguistics and Natural Language Processing.

I am interesting in becoming a visiting fellow at the Harvard University and I will like you to be my host during my visit.



Thank you.
